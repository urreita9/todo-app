- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with


- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React beautiful Drag n Drop



### What I learned

The biggest challenge here was managing the Drag and Drop. It was quite a mess working with state, filters and Drag Context, but I think it ended up pretty good. It's a great tool to learn.




### Continued development

I guess I could improve much more the drag and drop, but since it wasnÂ´t mandatory, I will continue on with some other project, and maybe, come back in the future and make the improvements.
